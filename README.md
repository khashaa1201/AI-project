これは、群集密度アプリケーションに機械学習技術の使用を組み込むための私のプロジェクトです。
My name is Kashbat, and I am a 21 year old student who is studying AI and ML techniques in Tokyo International University. My degree is called Digital business Innovation. It is a bit different degree from traditional bachelors like Computer Science or Business Administration. I chose this degree because it enabled me to solve real life problems by using AI and ML techniques. I come Mongolia’s capital called Ulaanbaatar, which is the coldest city on earth. To describe myself, I am really passionate student who loves AI and innovation. If I have to describe further myself by using three words. It would be Industrious, Sharp and easy-going. I am a person who loves to challenge myself so I am willing to challenge myself at any task.
