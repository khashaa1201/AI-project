# AI-project 
My name is Kashbat, and I am a 21 year old student who is studying AI and ML techniques in Tokyo International University. My degree is called Digital business Innovation. It is a bit different degree from traditional bachelors like Computer Science or Business Administration. I chose this degree because it enabled me to solve real life problems by using AI and ML techniques. I come Mongoliaâ€™s capital called Ulaanbaatar, which is the coldest city on earth. To describe myself, I am really passionate student who loves AI and innovation. If I have to describe further myself by using three words. It would be Industrious, Sharp and easy-going. I am a person who loves to challenge myself so I am willing to challenge myself at any task.
